        "simple": "Your task is to highlight the most important regions (either graphics or text) in a sequence of 10 to 15 images. Important regions are regions that help you understand what the image is about. You can select multiple regions per image. Try to be precise. You will have 1 minute per image, so focus on the most important elements first. You might be shown images with or without text. <b>Please ignore watermarks</b> (they will have a diamond pattern and have text in the middle. Act as if they weren't there).<br><br>You have 3 tools you can use to annotate images (in the menu bar on the right-side of the image). Please pick whichever you prefer. You can try out different options.<br><br><b>To annotate using the Stroke Fill (default):</b><br>(1) Click on the edge of the element you would like to trace around.<br>(2) While holding the mouse down, trace around the element until you reach your approximate starting point.<br>(3) A nice outline will be automatically created. If you are unsatisfied with it, you can click 'Undo'.<br><br>A demonstration of Stroke Fill can be seen in the sample video below.<br><br><b>To annotate using the Polygon Fill:</b><br>(1) Click on the Polygon Fill button on the right menu.<br>(2) Click on the edge of the element you want to annotate.<br>(3) Let go of the mouse and move it towards a new edge. A straight line between the starting point and your mouse position will be automatically created.<br>(3) Click again to generate a new point.<br>(4) Continue outlining the object until you reach your starting point, indicated by a blue circle. Clicking on the blue circle completes the annotation.<br><br><b>To annotate using the Regular Stroke:</b><br>(1) Click on the Regular Stroke button on the right menu.<br>(2) Pick a Brush Size (or go with the default).<br>(3) Paint over the whole image region you want to select as important.<br>If possible, try to avoid this method, as it produces noisy boundaries.<br><br>When you are done annotating all 10 images, you will see a completion screen, at which point you will be able to submit the HIT.<br><br>Note: this task should not take long. This is why there is a 1 minute time limit on each image. You do not need to use the full minute. Click 'Next' when you are done annotating an image.<br><br><b>WARNING: we will be measuring your input on each image. If your highlighted region is low effort or inaccurate, you will be blocked. Make sure that you label something in each image.</b><br><br><b>Please use Chrome or Firefox to complete this task.</b><br><br><br><br><i>Disclaimer: This HIT is part of a MIT scientific research project.
